# ClassMethod_InstanceMethod

Methods can be applied to an instance of the class or to the class itself.

``` objective-c
yourCar = [Car new];
[yourCar prep];
[yourCar getGas];
```

#Class methods

Class methods (also known as static methods) are similar in nature to class variables. These are methods that are associated directly with the class rather than the object instance; they therefore will not have access to object instance variables
